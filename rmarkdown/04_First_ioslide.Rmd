## I am R-Lady Chrissy

> I like R because of it's extreme flexibility and applicability to a broad range of
topics.

My favorite R packages are:

- ggplot2
- qplots
- RColorBrewer

## My favorite diamonds plot

```{r diamonds, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, price, color = cut))+
  geom_jitter()+
  theme_bw()+
  ggtitle('My favorite diamonds plot')

```
