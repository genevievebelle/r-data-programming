# R markdown tutorial 

This tutorial gives a quick overview how to write documents in 
[R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

It is adapted from a tutorial published by Sebkopf at
[Link](https://gist.github.com/sebkopf)

## Markdown

**Markdown** is a very basic and easy-to-use syntax for styling written documents.
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown.

### Headers

Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##`, up to six ones, in a 
row denote smaller heading sizes.

You can include a quote, using the > character before the line:

> R-Ladies Berlin are learning R markdown.

### Lists

Numbered lists - here to some useful resources for markdown:

1. [Markdown Basics from R-Studio](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html)
1. [Mastering Markdown from GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (this is where most of the examples above come from)

And the kind of things you can do with R markdown
if you want to go beyond the basics:

- [Lots of options for embedded R code](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html) (more details below)
- [Bibliographies and References](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
- [Interactive Documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html)
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before:
    - Like this
    - And this

### Equations

Equation support can be very handy if you need to provide some formulas in your
text, just use LaTeX [math](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics): $x=\sum\beta\frac{\pi^2}{\gamma_i}$

Or in case it's getting a bit more complicated:

$$
f(n) =
  \begin{cases}
    n/2       & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even}\\
    -(n+1)/2  & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}\\
  \end{cases}
$$

### Images

Embedding images is as easy as the following:

Now it's time to merge R and markdown!

## R markdown

**R markdown** is a version of Markdown that is expanded to support running R code
in between your text. The blocks of R code are called `chunks` and you can treat
them as individual little segments of code, you can jump back and forth between them,
run just individual ones or run all of them when you click the **Knit** button - this
will generate a document that includes both content as well as the output of any
embedded R code chunks within the document. This is an R code chunk:

```{r my-first-chunk}
data <- cars # get the cars data set as an example
summary(data) # show a summary of the data set
```

You can also print out your data in table format if you want to include it in
your document:

```{r, results="asis"}
library(knitr)
kable(head(data))
```

Or you can print out the value of a variable in your text, say the value of $\pi$
with **4 significant digits:** `r signif(pi, 4)` or the **number of data points** in
your data set: `r nrow(data)`.

And of course you can embed plots, for example:

```{r my-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10}
plot(data)
```

For additional information on R and R markdown, there are lots of great resources
on the internet and the R user community is very active and extremely helpful. 

 - [R reference manual](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf) (a great overview of many useful R commands)
 - [Regression analysis functions](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Ricci-refcard-regression.pdf) (statistical analysis is one of the great strengths of R, this is a handy overview of useful functionality)
 - [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (a Q&A site for programming, searching for answers here often provides very helpful information)
